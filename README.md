# HelloWorldProject

New to Ruby? New to git? Bewildered by gems and pull requests? Me too! Let's start small together and *say hello to the beautiful world* of Ruby gems and open source technology. 

## How it works

We want everyone to have the chance to say hello in whichever language they prefer. Have a look at (this class)[https://github.com/elsapet/hello_world_project/blob/master/lib/hello_world_project/translate.rb]. Is your language in the ```SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES``` hash? If not, (add it)[https://github.com/elsapet/hello_world_project#contributing]! If so, is it correct? Can you think of another greeting to add? (Add that one instead)[https://github.com/elsapet/hello_world_project#contributing]!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hello_world_project'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hello_world_project

## Usage



## Contributing
